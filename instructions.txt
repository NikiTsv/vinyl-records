General info:
'formstack-nikolay-fe/records' is where the FE project is located
'formstack-nikolay-be' is where the backend aws sam project is located
All cors is allowed by default for the demo.

1. Configure api url in the FE formstack-nikolay-fe/records/config.js (or use the one provided)
2. Create S3 bucket with public access and put cors policy from 'formstack-nikolay-be/s3-cors.config.txt'
3. Go to template.yml and configure getSignedUrlFunction's environment variables to match your S3 bucket name and region
4. You have to have AWS cli configured locally (aws configure command) and AWS SAM installed on your local machine
5. go to 'formstack-nikolay-be' and run 'sam deploy -g' to deploy the sam configuration to your AWS environment
6. To run FE locally - use 'npm install' then 'npm start'
7. To run deploy FE run 'npm run build' which will build the project for production in /build folder.
After this you can upload it to S3 or git as static web app.
