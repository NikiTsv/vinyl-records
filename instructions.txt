General info:
The web app is deployed on S3 and can be viewed on http://nikolay-records.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.
Login with 'demo' user to view with content or type your own to start blank.

'formstack-nikolay-fe/records' is where the FE project is located
'formstack-nikolay-be' is where the backend aws sam project is located, node env - 10.16.0

All cors is allowed by default for the demo.

1. Create S3 bucket with public access and put cors policy from 'formstack-nikolay-be/s3-cors.config.txt'.
    This is for image uploads.
2. Go to template.yml and configure getSignedUrlFunction's environment variables to match your S3 bucket name and region
    This is needed for the Signed Urls to work.
3. You should have AWS cli configured locally (aws configure command) and AWS SAM installed on your local machine
4. Go to 'formstack-nikolay-be' and run 'sam deploy -g' to deploy the sam configuration to your AWS environment
5. Find the api gateway url from the deployed sam template in AWS. Set the api url in the FE formstack-nikolay-fe/records/config.js
6. Configure s3 bucket name in 'formstack-nikolay-fe/records/config.js' (for the image uploads)

# You can skip the first 6 steps if you don't want to deploy the backend and just run the app locally with the already deployed BE (by me).
7. To run FE locally - use 'npm install' then 'npm start'
8. To run deploy FE run 'npm run build' which will build the project for production in /build folder.
After this you can upload it to S3 or git as static web app.
